        MDverse is the data catalogue of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
        It indexes, annotates and shares datasets and files related to MD simulations
        with the purpose of fostering dissemination and reuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        MDverse is not a data repository and does not host any MD data.
        It works like a search engine with added values for the MD community.
    </p>
    <p>
        MDverse metadata will be integrated into a the discovery platform developed by the EOSC <a href="https://lumenproject.eu/">LUMEN project</a>.

        MDverse has been created by Johanna Tiemann, Matthieu Chavent and Pierre Poulain.
        See original publication: <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">MDverse, shedding light on the dark matter of molecular dynamics simulations</a>, eLife, 2024 
        (DOI <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90061.3">10.7554/eLife.90061.3</a>).

        üìù The ‚ÄúDark Matter of Molecular Dynamics Simulations‚Äù refers to data that is technically accessible,
        but neither indexed, curated, or easily searchable.
